            <h1>1. Local storage and session storage – What's the Difference? </h1>
            <p>sessionStorage is similar to localStorage ; the difference is that while data in localStorage doesn't expire, data in sessionStorage is cleared when the page session ends. Whenever a document is loaded in a particular tab in the browser, a unique page session gets created and assigned to that particular tab.<br>
                LocalStorage as it's called it's local storage for your browsers, it can save up to 10MB, SessionStorage does the same, but as it's name saying, it's session based and will be deleted after closing your browser, also can save less than LocalStorage, like up to 5MB,
                <br>
                Web storage objects localStorage and sessionStorage allow to store key/value in the browser. Both key and value must be strings. The limit is 5mb+, depends on the browser. They do not expire.

            <h1>2.What is difference between global scope and block scope?  </h1>
            <p>The Global scope:

                A variable exists inside or outside a block. If a variable is declared outside all functions or curly braces ({}), it exists in the global scope. The global variables can be accessed by any line of code in the program, including inside blocks.In a browser environment, the global scope is controlled by the window object while in Node. js, it's controlled by the global object. <br>
                The Block scope:

So far, we’ve seen variables defined with the var keyword. Var can declare a variable either in the global or local scope. The variables that are declared within the block scope are comparable to local ones. They are available within the block that they are defined.

The main difference between the local scope and block scope is that the block statements (e.g. if conditions or for loops), don't create a new scope. So the var keyword will not have an effect, because the variables are still in the same scope.

            <h1>3.How does the javascript event loop work? </h1>
            <p>The Event Loop has one simple job — to monitor the Call Stack and the Callback Queue. If the Call Stack is empty, the Event Loop will take the first event from the queue and will push it to the Call Stack, which effectively runs it. Such an iteration is called a tick in the Event Loop. <br>
