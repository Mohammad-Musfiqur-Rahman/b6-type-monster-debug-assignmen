            <h1>1. Local storage and session storage â€“ What's the Difference? </h1>
            <p>sessionStorage is similar to localStorage ; the difference is that while data in localStorage doesn't expire, data in sessionStorage is cleared when the page session ends. Whenever a document is loaded in a particular tab in the browser, a unique page session gets created and assigned to that particular tab.<br>
                LocalStorage as it's called it's local storage for your browsers, it can save up to 10MB, SessionStorage does the same, but as it's name saying, it's session based and will be deleted after closing your browser, also can save less than LocalStorage, like up to 5MB,
                <br>
                Web storage objects localStorage and sessionStorage allow to store key/value in the browser. Both key and value must be strings. The limit is 5mb+, depends on the browser. They do not expire.
